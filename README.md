# List-KR
This is a web filter for websites in Korean language, to be used with [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) ad blocker and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

List-KR aims to filter ads and anti-adblock.

List-KR is focused on Korean websites and app, and it is recommended to use List-KR together with AdGuard Base filter.

List-KR is optimized for AdGuard Windows, Mac, Android, Browser Extension and uBO.
Therefore, List-KR cannot be added on AdBlock Plus because AdBlock Plus does not support advanced syntax (e.g. `!#include`, `#%#//scriptlet()`, `##+js` and `$redirect`).

Due to technical problem, a visitor of some website need to do some instruction.
Please keep reading this document.

If you want to block tracker or anti-rightclick scripts, please enable AdGuard Tracking Protection filter, AdGuard URL Tracking filter or AdGuard Annoyances filter.
